# Save Your Toll Money...

We have the real deal Philly Cheesesteaks right here at Dar's Steaks!  
  

What makes the best cheesesteak?  Some say it's all about the meat.  It must be a good quality cut of beef and seasoned to perfection.  Ribeye is the best!  
  
Some would say it's in how the meat is treated once it's on the grill.  Some prefer it left in whole slices, while others prefer a fine chop.  
  
Some say it's all about the bread.  It must be fresh and soft on the inside: perfect to sop up all that delicious cheesesteak flavor with the sensational crusty exterior strong enough to hold it all together.
